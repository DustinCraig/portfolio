              All around tech enthusiast who finds joy in crafting solutions
              through programming and system design. When I'm not on my
              computer, I enjoy playing table top games and starting (sometimes
              completing) projects around my house.

          At 12 years old, while playing a video game, a sudden wave of
          curiosity swept over me. I thought: "how is all of this working"? From
          that moment on, I've never looked back. Coding is not just a
          profession for me; it's become a way of life. Having the ability to
          bring ideas to life with just a computer is and has always been
          mind-blowing to me. Whether it's optimizing performance, conquering
          complex challenges, or building seamless user experiences, I find
          immense satisfaction in transforming concepts into reality with just
          key strokes.
